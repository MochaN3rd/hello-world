# hello-world
First Github repo!
Raymond Blake here! Born and raised in California, currently residning in LA County, I was adopted AND also grew up in Foster Care, on the Central Coast (Santa Barbara County). Had a little bit of a rough childhood, but what doesn't kill you makes you stronger! I started this Github so that I could pursue my dream of becoing a Full-stack Software developer!1 I look foward to this journey even though I know it's gonna a for the long haul, burning the candle at both ends.
